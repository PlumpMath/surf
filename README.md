Surf (C# web browser) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/32f2lq7n76merw5w)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jothousand/surf)
====

Surf is a lightweight, experimental web browser, designed in C#. It runs on CefSharp, a well known Chromium based engine.

Its aim is to provide an experimental browser that is built using .NET that runs safe and fast on Chromium, without all the extra junk like Google Sign in. Surf also provides respect for privacy, by not unnecessarily 'phoning home' all the time.
